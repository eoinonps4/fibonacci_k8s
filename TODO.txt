When get this up and running, try convert to using my own fibonacci directory instead of using version of app
in checkpoint files.
go folder by folder replacing and making sure it all works

build a file that has all the config files as one, maybe organised by client,server, worker,redis,postgres
so that we go from about 11 files to 5/6. Maybe DBs go in one file
